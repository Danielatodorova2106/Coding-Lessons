Problem:
Your task is to model an application. It is very simple.
The mandatory models of our application are 3:  Human, Worker and Student.
The parent class â€“ Human should have first name and last name. Every student has a faculty number.
Every worker has a week salary and work hours per day.
It should be able to calculate the money he earns by an hour. You can see the constraints below.
Input
On the first input line, you will be given info about a single student - a name and faculty number.
On the second input line, you will be given info about a single worker - first name, last name, salary and working hours.
Output
You should print the info about the student first,
followed by a single blank line and after that the info about the worker in the given formats:
- Print the student info in the following format:
    First Name: {student's first name}
    Last Name: {student's last name}
    Faculty number: {student's faculty number}

- Print the worker info in the following format:
    First Name: {worker's first name}
    Last Name: {worker's second name}
    Week Salary: {worker's salary}
    Hours per day: {worker's working hours}
    Salary per hour: {worker's salary per hour}
Print exactly two digits after every double value's decimal separator (e.g. 10.00).
Consider the workweek from Monday to Friday. A faculty number should be consisted only of digits and letters.

Constraints:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter:        |Constraint                         |Exception Message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human first name  |Should start with a capital letter |"Expected upper case letter! Argument: firstName"
Human first name  |Should be more than 3 symbols      |"Expected length at least 4 symbols! Argument: firstName"
Human last name   |Should start with a capital letter |"Expected upper case letter! Argument: lastName"
Human last name   |Should be more than 2 symbols      |"Expected length at least 3 symbols! Argument: lastName "
Human last name   |Should be in range [5..10] symbols |"Invalid faculty number!"
Week salary       |Should be more than 10             |"Expected value mismatch! Argument: weekSalary"
Working hours     |Should be in the range [1..12]     |"Expected value mismatch! Argument: workHoursPerDay"

Examples:
    Input:
        Ivan Ivanov 08
        Pesho Kirov 1590 10
        Stefo Mk321 0812111
        Ivcho Ivancov 1590 10
    Output:
        Invalid faculty number!
        First Name: Stefo
        Last Name: Mk321
        Faculty number: 0812111

        First Name: Ivcho
        Last Name: Ivancov
        Week Salary: 1590.00
        Hours per day: 10.00
        Salary per hour: 31.80
