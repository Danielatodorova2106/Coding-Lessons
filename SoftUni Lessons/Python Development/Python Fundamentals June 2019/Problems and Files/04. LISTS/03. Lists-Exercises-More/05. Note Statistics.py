05. * Note Statistics

Problem:
In music, certain frequencies correspond to certain musical notes (example: A -> 440hz, C# -> 554.37hz).
You will be given frequencies as real numbers on the first line of the input (space-separated).
Your task is to convert the numbers to their musical note representation,
then separate them into naturals (C, B, F and etc.) and sharp notes (C#, F#, A#, etc.).
After that, print both lists in the console in the format described in the examples.
After you print them, sum each listâ€™s frequencies and print it on the console, rounded to the second decimal place.

Constraints
The frequencies in the input will be constrained to this chart:
Note	Frequency
C	    261.63hz
C#	    277.18hz
D	    293.66hz
D#	    311.13hz
E	    329.63hz
F	    349.23hz
F#	    369.99hz
G	    392.00hz
G#	    415.30hz
A	    440.00hz
A#	    466.16hz
B	    493.88hz
